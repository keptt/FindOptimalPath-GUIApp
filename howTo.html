    <h3>HowTo</h3>
    <p>
        This app is targeted at finding the path that has the biggest values of its nodes (cells),
        that are integers, and displaying the result to user
    </p>

    <p style='padding-top:10px'>
        App can be run following a number of user-specified modes:
    <ul>
        <li>Brute force</li>
        <li>Dynamic programming</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        This modes can be specified in "Approach" section of the app (last dropdown menu if count from top to bottom).
    <br>
        The "Brute force" mode or approach is an inefficient way of finding the greatest path because it uses
        full recursive grid traverse. This approach takes quiet a lot of time even on small grids like in this app and
        is mainly present in the app for illustratory purposes. It will basically show you, how it goes on to find needed
        path and is useful as you are able to see all the flaws of the approach (e. g. inefficiency).
    </p>
    <p>
        On the other hand, "Dynamic programming" mode employees a fast-performing approach. Which is based on the self-titled
        math algorithm which is O(n) space complexity as it creates the same sized grid in memory for its proxy calculations.

        User is also able to specify and trigger a few other options:
        <ul>
            <li>"Upperbound" - change upper limit of the grid integer values (Click "Ok" to confirm the change)</li>
            <li>"Lowerbound" - change lower limit of the grid integer values (Click "Ok" to confirm the change)</li>
            <li>"Grid height" - redraw the grid and change it's number of rows to specified</li>
            <li>"Grid width" - redraw the grid and change it's number of columns to specified</li>
            <li>"Path highlighting" - chose how you would like path highlighting (coloring of nodes of the grid while triversing the grid) to occur (faster/slower) or turn it off</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        There are four buttons on the main window of the app (excluding buttons from header-menu):
        <ul>
            <li>"Rerandom grid" - redraws and rerandoms all node values of the grid. It is located in the top of the left section</li>
            <li>"Go" - starts the program, located at the bottom of the left section together with "Stop" button</li>
            <li>"Stop" - stops the running program if clicked one time, on second click it erases all coloring from grid and sets all nodes back to the default color</li>
            <li>"Clear" - located in the middle-button section of the window, under the grid, at the "Result" section, this button is solely responsible for flushing output from the "Result section"</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note that after the program started running all buttons and dropdown sections except from "Stop" and "Clear" must not be interacted with
